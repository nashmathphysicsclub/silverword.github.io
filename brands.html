				<p>These are the 3 most common/popular MX style switch brands.</p>
				<h1>Cherry</h1>
				<p>Cherry was the original creator of the MX style switch. Although they started the trend, innovation has gone no where. The quality hasn't improved; in fact the quality dropped significantly. They are scratchy and not smooth. This is not what you want to go for.</p>
				<h1>Gateron</h1>
				<p>Gateron is a Japanese company that makes cheaper and higher quality clones of Cherry's MX switches. When the switches are lubed, they are unimaginably smooth. Still no innovation here however.</p>
				<h1>Kailh</h1>
				<p> Problably the most notable brand over 2017 for their amazing innovation on the typical MX design. The main focus is not their MX clones(unfortunatly really low quality), but rather their box MX switches. A box is put around the stem for more stability and water resistance. The smoothness for an unlubed switch is pretty much unparalleled from a mass manufacturer.</p>
